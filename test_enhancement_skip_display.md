# Test Results: AI Enhancement Skip Display

## Test Scenario
Testing whether the "AI Enhancement Progress" window properly displays which steps will be skipped BEFORE the enhancement process begins.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProspectDetailsModal.tsx
- Updated to pass `plannedSteps` from the enhancement state to the EnhancementProgress component

### 2. EnhancementProgress.tsx  
- Added `plannedSteps` to the component props interface
- Updated step logic to check `plannedSteps` first to determine if a step will be skipped
- Improved visual distinction between:
  - Steps that will be skipped (yellow indicators shown immediately)
  - Steps currently being processed (spinning icon)
  - Steps that have been completed (green checkmark)
  - Steps that were skipped during processing (gray indicator)

### 3. Backend (llm_processing.py)
- Already correctly determines and sends `planned_steps` when enhancement is queued
- Checks for existing data and marks steps that will be skipped

## Testing Steps

1. Open the application at http://localhost:3002
2. Navigate to a prospect that has some existing enhanced data (e.g., existing NAICS code)
3. Click on the prospect to open the modal view
4. Click "Enhance with AI" button
5. Observe the "AI Enhancement Progress" window

## Expected Behavior

When clicking "Enhance with AI":
1. The progress window should appear immediately
2. Steps that will be skipped should show with yellow indicators and text like "(will skip - already enhanced)"
3. This should happen BEFORE any processing begins
4. As processing continues, completed steps should show green checkmarks
5. Skipped steps should maintain their skip indicator throughout

## Visual Indicators

- **Yellow circle with X**: Step will be skipped (pre-determined)
- **Gray circle with X**: Step was skipped during processing  
- **Green checkmark**: Step completed successfully
- **Spinning icon**: Step currently being processed
- **Empty circle**: Step pending

## Benefits

- Users get immediate visibility into what will actually be processed
- Better time estimation as users know which steps will be skipped
- Clear visual distinction between planned skips vs runtime skips
- Improved user experience with transparent processing information
