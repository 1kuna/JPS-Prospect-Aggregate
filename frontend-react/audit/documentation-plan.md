# Documentation Plan for JPS-Prospect-Aggregate

This plan outlines the approach for documenting the component library and codebase in a way that's optimized for both human developers and agentic LLM AI models.

## Documentation Strategy

1. **Centralized Markdown Documentation**
   - Create a dedicated `/docs` directory at the root of the project
   - Use markdown files which are easily parsed by LLMs
   - Structure with clear headings, lists, and code examples
   - Include a main `README.md` that serves as an index to all documentation

2. **Component Documentation Structure**
   - For each component, create a standardized documentation format:
     ```
     # ComponentName
     
     ## Purpose
     One-sentence description of what the component does.
     
     ## Props
     | Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
     |------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
     | prop1 | string | Yes | - | What this prop controls |
     
     ## Usage Examples
     ```jsx
     <ComponentName prop1="value" />
     ```
     
     ## Implementation Details
     Brief explanation of how the component works internally.
     
     ## Related Components
     Links to related components.
     ```

3. **Code Comments**
   - Add JSDoc-style comments directly in the component code
   - These comments will be available to LLMs when they read the source files
   - Include type information, descriptions, and examples

4. **Directory Structure Documentation**
   - Create a `project-structure.md` file explaining the organization of the codebase
   - Document naming conventions and file organization patterns
   - Explain the purpose of each major directory

5. **Pattern Documentation**
   - Document common patterns used throughout the codebase
   - Explain architectural decisions and why certain approaches were chosen
   - Include a "Do's and Don'ts" section for each pattern

6. **Dependency Graph**
   - Create a simple visualization or text-based representation of component dependencies
   - Show which components depend on which other components
   - This helps LLMs understand the relationships between components

7. **Changelog Integration**
   - Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file that documents changes to components
   - Include version information, breaking changes, and migration guides
   - This helps LLMs understand the evolution of the codebase

8. **Examples Directory**
   - Create an `/examples` directory with complete usage examples
   - Include common scenarios and edge cases
   - These serve as reference implementations for LLMs

## Implementation Priority

1. First: Centralized Markdown Documentation (Step 1) ✅
   - Created a dedicated `/docs` directory at the root of the project
   - Organized documentation in markdown files with clear structure
   - Added a main `README.md` that serves as an index

2. Second: Component Documentation Structure (Step 2) ✅
   - Created standardized documentation for all component categories
   - Documented UI components, form components, layout components, data display components, and hooks
   - Included purpose, props, usage examples, and related components

3. Third: Directory Structure Documentation (Step 4) ✅
   - Created `project-structure.md` explaining the organization of the codebase
   - Documented naming conventions in `naming-conventions.md`
   - Explained code organization patterns in `code-organization.md`

4. Fourth: Pattern Documentation (Step 5) ✅
   - Documented common patterns used throughout the codebase in `/docs/patterns/`
   - Created documentation for state management, data fetching, error handling, and form handling
   - Included best practices and examples

5. Fifth: Changelog Integration (Step 7) ✅
   - Created a `CHANGELOG.md` file that documents changes to components
   - Included version information and notable changes

6. Remaining steps to be implemented as needed:
   - Code Comments (Step 3)
   - Dependency Graph (Step 6)
   - Examples Directory (Step 8)

## Documentation Consolidation Strategy ✅

After reviewing the initial documentation structure, we've identified that having too many separate files can be problematic for LLM context windows. To address this, we're implementing a consolidation strategy:

1. **Consolidated Component Documentation**
   - Merge all component documentation (UI, forms, layout, data-display, hooks) into a single `components.md` file
   - Use clear section headers to maintain organization
   - Include a table of contents for easy navigation

2. **Consolidated Pattern Documentation**
   - Combine all pattern documentation (state-management, data-fetching, error-handling, form-handling) into a single `patterns.md` file
   - Maintain clear section headers for each pattern
   - Include cross-references between related patterns

3. **Consolidated API Documentation**
   - Merge all API documentation (endpoints, models, authentication) into a single `api.md` file
   - Organize with clear sections and subsections
   - Include a table of contents for navigation

4. **Project Structure Documentation**
   - Combine project structure documentation (project-structure, naming-conventions, code-organization) into a single `project-structure.md` file
   - Use hierarchical organization to maintain clarity

5. **Supporting Documentation**
   - Maintain separate files for CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, and TROUBLESHOOTING as these serve distinct purposes and are typically accessed independently

This consolidation reduces the total number of documentation files from 19 to 7, making it much more manageable for LLM context windows while preserving all the valuable information.

## Optimization for LLM Consumption

- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Provide explicit type information
- Include clear examples
- Avoid ambiguous language
- Use descriptive headings and subheadings
- Keep documentation files focused on a single topic
- Cross-reference related documentation
