# Phase 2: Common Components Implementation Summary

## Components Created

We've successfully created the following reusable components:

1. **Layout Components**
   - `PageLayout`: A standardized page layout with title, description, actions, and error handling
   - `PageSkeleton`: A loading skeleton for pages

2. **Data Display Components**
   - `DataTable`: A reusable table component with pagination
   - `StatsCard` and `StatsGrid`: Components for displaying statistics in a card layout

3. **Form Components**
   - `FormWrapper`: A wrapper component for forms with standardized layout and error handling

4. **Hooks**
   - `useDataFetching`: A hook for fetching data with loading, error, and pagination handling

## Refactoring Progress

We've refactored the following components to use our new common components:

1. **Dashboard Page**
   - Replaced custom page layout with `PageLayout`
   - Replaced custom loading skeleton with `PageSkeleton`
   - Replaced custom cards with `StatsCard` and `StatsGrid`
   - Replaced custom table with `DataTable`

2. **DataSourceForm**
   - Replaced custom form implementation with `FormWrapper`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Reduction**
   - The Dashboard page was reduced from ~250 lines to ~150 lines
   - The DataSourceForm was reduced from ~120 lines to ~70 lines

2. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Common patterns are now centralized in reusable components
   - Changes to UI patterns can be made in one place
   - Consistent error handling and loading states across the application

3. **Simplified Imports**
   - Created index files for components and hooks for easier imports
   - Components can now be imported from `@/components` instead of individual files

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Continue Refactoring**
   - Apply the same refactoring to the remaining pages (DataSources, Proposals, etc.)
   - Identify any additional common patterns that could be extracted

2. **Evaluate Impact**
   - Measure the reduction in total lines of code
   - Assess the improvement in maintainability
   - Gather feedback from the team

3. **Documentation**
   - Ensure all components are well-documented
   - Create usage examples for each component
   - Update the README with guidelines for creating new components
