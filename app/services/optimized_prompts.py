"""Optimized prompts for LLM enhancement operations"""

NAICS_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are a NAICS classification expert. Analyze ALL available procurement information to determine the TOP 3 most appropriate NAICS codes.

PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:
Title: "{title}"
Description: "{description}"
Agency: "{agency}"
Contract Type: "{contract_type}"
Set Aside: "{set_aside}"
Estimated Value: "{estimated_value}"
Additional Details: "{additional_info}"

Classification Guidelines:
1. Use NAICS 2022 edition codes (6-digit) - RETURN CODES ONLY, NO DESCRIPTIONS
2. Analyze ALL provided information - title, description, agency, contract type, etc.
3. Consider agency context (DOD=defense, HHS=healthcare, etc.)
4. Common government categories:
   - IT Services: 541511, 541512, 541513, 541519
   - Construction: 236220, 237110, 237310, 237990
   - Professional Services: 541330, 541611, 541618, 541690, 541715
   - Manufacturing: 334111, 334220, 334511, 334516
   - Healthcare: 621111, 621511, 621610
   - Administrative: 561110, 561210, 561320, 561612
5. Set-aside programs may indicate specific industry focus
6. Contract value can indicate complexity/scope
7. Be specific - use 6-digit codes, not 2-4 digit categories

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY codes - descriptions will be looked up separately from official NAICS database.

Return ONLY valid JSON array with up to 3 codes:
[
  {{"code": "541511", "confidence": 0.85}},
  {{"code": "541512", "confidence": 0.70}},
  {{"code": "541519", "confidence": 0.60}}
]

Confidence scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear industry match with specific keywords/context
- 0.7-0.89: Good match but some ambiguity
- 0.5-0.69: Possible match, secondary service
- <0.5: Weak match but potentially relevant"""

VALUE_PARSING_PROMPT = """You are a contract value parser. Extract and normalize the monetary value from the given text.

Value Text: "{value_text}"

CRITICAL RULE: A value is EITHER a range OR a single value - NEVER BOTH!
- If it's a RANGE: Only populate min/max, single MUST be null
- If it's a SINGLE: Only populate single, min/max MUST be null
- NEVER calculate midpoints for ranges!

Parsing Rules:
1. Common patterns to recognize:
   - Ranges: "$1M-$5M", ">$250K to <$750K", "between $X and $Y", "$250,000 to $700,000", "0K to 250K"
   - Single values: "$2.5 million", "NTE $500K", "up to $10M"
   - Abbreviations: K=thousand, M/MM=million, B=billion
   - Multi-year: "5-year $10M" = $10M total (not $50M)
   
2. RANGE DETECTION (Two distinct amounts = RANGE):
   Examples of RANGES:
   - "$100K to $500K" → RANGE
   - "$100K - $500K" → RANGE  
   - "between $100K and $500K" → RANGE
   - "0K to 250K" → RANGE
   - ">$250K to <$750K" → RANGE
   
3. For RANGES:
   - min: lower bound amount
   - max: upper bound amount
   - single: MUST BE null (DO NOT calculate midpoint!)
   - is_range: true
   Examples:
   - "0K to 250K" → min=0, max=250000, single=null
   - "$100K-$500K" → min=100000, max=500000, single=null
   
4. For SINGLE values:
   - single: the amount
   - min: MUST BE null
   - max: MUST BE null
   - is_range: false
   Examples:
   - "$250K" → single=250000, min=null, max=null
   
5. Special cases (these are SINGLE values, not ranges):
   - "Greater than X": single=X*1.5, min=null, max=null
   - "Less than X" or "Below X": single=X*0.75, min=null, max=null
   - "Up to X" or "NTE X": single=X*0.75, min=null, max=null

VALIDATION: Your response MUST have either:
- (min + max) with single=null OR
- (single) with min=null and max=null
NEVER return all three values!

Return ONLY valid JSON:
For ranges: {{"min": 0, "max": 250000, "single": null, "is_range": true}}
For single: {{"min": null, "max": null, "single": 250000, "is_range": false}}"""


TITLE_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT = """You are a government procurement title optimizer. Your job is to rewrite vague, unclear, or generic procurement titles into clear, descriptive, actionable titles that accurately reflect what is being procured.

Original Title: "{title}"
Description: "{description}"
Agency: "{agency}"

Guidelines for enhanced titles:
1. BE SPECIFIC: Replace vague terms with specific ones
   - Bad: "Services" → Good: "IT Support Services"
   - Bad: "Support" → Good: "Maintenance and Technical Support"
   - Bad: "Requirements" → Good: "Software Development Requirements"

2. INCLUDE KEY DETAILS: Add important context from description
   - Include technology/system names if mentioned
   - Include location if relevant
   - Include duration if it's a key characteristic

3. MAKE IT ACTIONABLE: Use action-oriented language
   - "Development of..." "Procurement of..." "Maintenance of..."
   - Avoid passive constructions

4. KEEP GOVERNMENT CONTEXT: Preserve important government/military terminology
   - Keep acronyms that are widely understood
   - Preserve security classifications if mentioned
   - Keep agency-specific terms that add value

5. OPTIMAL LENGTH: 8-15 words typically
   - Long enough to be descriptive
   - Short enough to be scannable
   - Remove unnecessary articles (a, an, the) if it improves flow

6. EXAMPLES:
   - "IT Services" → "Cloud Infrastructure Development and Migration Services"
   - "Support Services" → "Help Desk and User Support Services for DOD Systems"
   - "Requirements Document" → "Technical Requirements for Enterprise Software Modernization"
   - "Professional Services" → "Cybersecurity Assessment and Implementation Services"

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{"enhanced_title": "Clear Descriptive Title Here", "confidence": 0.85, "reasoning": "Brief explanation of changes made"}}

Confidence guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Original title was very vague, significant improvement made
- 0.7-0.89: Moderate improvement, some ambiguity resolved
- 0.5-0.69: Minor improvement, original was somewhat clear
- <0.5: Original title was already clear, minimal changes needed"""
