class PageInteractionScraper(NavigationMixin, DownloadMixin, DataProcessingMixin, BaseScraper):
    """
    A specialized scraper base class for scrapers that heavily interact with web pages,
    download files, and process them.

    It inherits functionalities from:
    - NavigationMixin: For common page navigation tasks (clicking, filling forms, etc.).
    - DownloadMixin: For handling file downloads (triggered by clicks, direct URLs).
    - DataProcessingMixin: For processing downloaded data (reading files, transforming, loading to DB).
    - BaseScraper: For core browser setup, logging, and overall structure.

    Scrapers inheriting from this class will have access to methods from all these
    parent classes and mixins. They would typically override or implement:
    - `scrape()`: The main orchestration method.
    - Specific abstract methods if any were defined in mixins (though current mixins
      provide default implementations or placeholders).
    - Their own `__init__` to call `super().__init__(source_name, base_url, ...)`.

    Example usage:
        class SpecificWebsiteScraper(PageInteractionScraper):
            def __init__(self, debug_mode=False):
                super().__init__(
                    source_name="Specific Website",
                    base_url="https://example.com",
                    debug_mode=debug_mode
                )

                # Use methods from NavigationMixin like self.navigate_to_url(), self.click_element()

                download_button_selector = "#downloadButton"
