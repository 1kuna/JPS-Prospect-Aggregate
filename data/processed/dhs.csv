 1.	Establish and Operate Permanent DHS Innovation Hub
 
 1.1	In coordination with T2C, DWX will establish a permanent DHS Innovation Hub (“HSWERX”) and associated ecosystem(s) through a hybrid innovation environment for the duration of the PIA.  The hybrid innovation environment leverages virtual platforms and tools as well as physical collaboration spaces in the National Capital Region and other locations, as appropriate to meet the needs of DHS and the homeland security enterprise.
 
 1.2	DWX will develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for managing and maintaining HSWERX to promote and improve DHS technology transfer outcomes.
 
 1.3	In accordance with the DHS Use of PIAs Guide and the above-referenced SOPs, DWX will:
 
 1.3.1	Create and expand the HSWERX Innovation Ecosystem (“ecosystem”) to enable and facilitate technical interchange, collaboration, and capture of technology developments and opportunities of interest and relevance to DHS.
 
 1.3.2	Provide mechanisms that facilitate ecosystem interaction with DHS. These mechanisms include but are not limited to:
 
 •	Government-only Collaboration Event: Government participates in design thinking sessions to prioritize requirements for a problem set. May lead to a full CE.
 •	Collaboration Event (CE):  Open forum with government, industry, academia, national labs. Employs design thinking to identify specific challenges and develop actionable plans to address them. Results shape future Assessment Events. 
 •	Assessment Event (AE):  Government identifies specific problem; DWX leverages its ecosystem to attract best-of-breed solution submissions. Selected participants meet directly with government end users to discuss and demonstrate technologies.
 •	Rapid Prototyping Event (RPE):  Rapid identification and prototyping of solutions to drive effective outcomes to complex problem areas using low-cost, innovative technologies. May follow a CE or AE.
 •	Feasibility Study:  Preliminary investigation into the potential benefits associated with undertaking a specific technology or method. The purpose is to conduct an in-depth analysis and determine efficacy and what (if any) future resource investments will yield a desirable result.
 
 2.	Facilitate DHS Collaboration with the Innovation Ecosystem
 
 2.1	DWX will design, plan, facilitate, and host events to enable potential collaborators to discuss and address DHS problem sets. Potential collaborators include small and large businesses, universities, national labs, other government agencies, and industry leaders in research, development, and manufacturing.
 
 2.2	DWX will coordinate with OIP’s innovation funding programs, such as the DHS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), and the DHS Prize program, to amplify these opportunities across the HSWERX ecosystem. 
 
 2.3	Leveraging its existing network of hubs, DWX will facilitate interagency collaboration where appropriate to address DHS challenges.  
 
 2.4	DWX will promote licensing opportunities available for DHS owned and OUP sponsored intellectual property by leveraging its network and ecosystem. 
 
 2.5	DWX will provide and/or arrange event services as required or desired by DHS and its stakeholders.

CIP pursues doing that by providing collaborative and consistent services that empower our customers inside and outside of the Agency to improve their programs, processes, and decision-making.  
 CIP’s authority is found within the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) Section 650 states that the FEMA Administrator, in coordination with the National Council on Disability and the National Advisory Council, shall establish a remedial action management program to: 
 •	Analyze training, exercises, and real-world events to identify and disseminate lessons learned and best practices; 
 •	Generate and disseminate, as appropriate, after-action reports to participants in exercises and real-world events; and, 
 •	Conduct remedial action tracking and long-term trend analysis. 
 FEMA Directive 107-1, Continuous Improvement Program, defines the policy and responsibilities of the FEMA CIP in support of learning from disasters. The principles of CIP’s support include improving Agency incident management and incident support capabilities; providing a consistent Agency approach; making information available to enable learning and support decision making; empowering FEMA programs to improve and recognize success, and to support preparedness.  
 CIP supports the Agency’s learning on critical priorities. For the 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan and resulting Annual Planning Guidance, CIP engages with program offices to gather data, conduct analysis, generate products, and track learning on topics that include equity, resilience, and readiness. These efforts seek to provide timely, actionable information to field, Regional, and headquarters partners that prompt action and improve future preparedness and operations.  
 As the number of disasters and their severity continues to grow, and the Agency embraces a culture of learning, there is an ongoing need to ensure that these opportunities to assess operations and improve in serving survivors are not lost. 
 This contract will enable FEMA to build greater capacity in supporting ongoing learning and surging for new, novel, and complex requirements. The ability to issue call orders on the preceding contract was vital during the COVID-19 operations and learning and has helped provide rich analytical and assessment capacity throughout the agency. The contract has also enabled intensive analytical efforts requested by the Administrator and other agency leadership to assess the direct housing mission, Public Assistance, and evacuation planning and operations, to enable improvements in future operations.

Given a last known position (LKP) or estimated initial position (EIP), accurate estimates of the sea surface currents in the vicinity of those positions are critical to provide accurate estimates of the drift of the survivors or survivor's craft away from the LKP or EIP at the time of searches.  A self-­ locating datum marker buoy (SLDMB) is an efficient method to obtain sea surface currents in the vicinity of an LKP or EIP during a SAR case either to provide data directly to the Coast Guard's Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS) or to assess the quality of various sea surface current products available to SAROPS by comparing drift of the SLDMB to their simulated drift in SAROPS.
 Self-Locating Datum Marker Buoys are oceanographic drifters that continually transmit their position and other environmental data in support of SAR missions. They are also used to mark the location of objects in the water. SLDMBs are carried onboard and must be safely deployed from both surface and air assets. They are deployed in heavy/inclement weather conditions and in both salt and fresh water. SLDMBs are frequently deployed in harsh weather conditions (e.g.: high winds and waves, storm and icing conditions, etc.). There are restrictions on the size, weight, ease of use, and reliability of SLDMBs to support these deployment environments.
 Oceanographically, SLDMBs must drift with the upper one meter of the ocean, minimizing slippage with the water and rectification of the wave motions. They operate on the open oceans and the Great Lakes.","334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufactur",5000000.0,$5M TO $10M,2025-03-28,2025-04-01,USCG/ALC,Elizabeth City,NC,USA,Firm Fixed Price,,,"{'contract_vehicle': 'Indefinite Delivery Contract', 'small_business_program': 'SB', 'contract_status': 'Follow-on to Existing Contract', 'contract_number': '70Z03820DE0000004', 'contractor': 'METOCEAN', 'primary_contact_first_name': 'Jordan', 'primary_contact_last_name': 'Ownley', 'primary_contact_phone': '(571) 613-5909', 'primary_contact_email': 'Samuel.J.Ownley2@uscg.mil', 'forecast_published': '02/24/2025', 'forecast_previously_published': '11/06/2024'}"

Application Security Platform (ASP) Static Application Security Testing.  USCIS requires a cloud native unified application security platform which can be hosted within USCIS's Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. USCIS's applications are made up of many different components (e.g., custom source code, Infrastructure as Code, APIs, Open-source libraries). This poses a challenge for USCIS as the attack surface has expanded and become more complex. USCIS needs a solution that will automatically show how the different components of the application interact with each other and where/how they are deployed. Software Composition Analysis.  USCIS requires a Software Composition Analysis solution that provides real time threat intelligence on malicious packages, in addition to traditional vulnerability assessments of open-source libraries and applications. The threat landscape has evolved and in recent years there has been a rise in adversaries imbedding malicious code into popular open-source libraries as a backdoor into the enterprise. To stay ahead of this threat, a unified application security platform that encompasses SAST and SCA will allow USCIS to quickly visualize how an application operates, and where lateral movement could occur. Without this capability, USCIS will be unable to understand the context of identified vulnerabilities and will struggle to prioritize remediation efforts.

The DHS Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Cost Analysis Division (CAD), is responsible for cost analysis oversight for major acquisition programs in the entire DHS portfolio. The DHS Components are responsible for developing their cost estimates at the program level and overseeing the cost estimates for both non-major and delegated major acquisition programs. The purpose of this Specialized Cost Services (SCS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) order is to provide FEMA with cost estimation services to decrease the time it takes to develop life cycle cost estimates (LCCE) and ultimately improve the cost estimating capability for FEMA. Reliable flood hazard data is the foundation of credible flood risk assessments, and these assessments serve a critical role as communities engage in the mitigation planning process. Federal statutes require that FEMA identify and map the Nation’s flood-prone areas and to establish flood-risk zones in these areas. Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) Information Technology (IT) and Non-IT Acquisition Programs were established to not only map flood-prone areas around the nation, but to also provide communities with consistent risk-based approach to assessing potential vulnerability and losses. By analyzing and depicting flood risk, communities and the American public can better understand that risk and make informed decisions to reduce vulnerability. Risk MAP IT and Non-IT Programs establish an integrated flood risk management approach that leverages and enhances the previously developed data from the Flood Map Modernization Program. Risk MAP provides an integrated web-accessible national assessment of flooding risks based on quality flood hazard data. This information enables communities to develop mitigation plans and make informed risk management decisions. Further, FEMA collaborates with local, State, regional, tribal, national, and other Federal partners in communicating these objectives and implementing Risk MAP. Because FEMA’s efforts extend throughout the nation, implementing Risk MAP helps maintain the engineering capability in the State and private sectors—sustaining jobs and stimulating the economy. The Risk MAP IT and Non-IT Programs are both Post-Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) 3 – Sustainment within the Acquisition Lifecycle Framework. The Risk MAP non-IT Program is a FEMA Level 1 Acquisition Program, and the Risk MAP IT Program is a Level 2 Acquisition Program.",541330 - Engineering Services,1000000.0,$1M TO $2M,2025-01-13,2025-04-01,FEMA,Washington,DC,USA,Firm Fixed Price,Full,,"{'contract_vehicle': 'BPA Call (FAR Part 8 or 13 Multiple Award BPA)', 'small_business_program': 'SB', 'contract_status': 'Follow-on to Existing Contract', 'contract_number': '70RDAD23A00000011 70FA6024F00000043', 'contractor': 'Technomics', 'primary_contact_first_name': 'Matthew', 'primary_contact_last_name': 'Lucas', 'primary_contact_phone': '(202) 702-4458', 'primary_contact_email': 'matthew.lucas@fema.dhs.gov', 'forecast_published': '11/19/2024', 'forecast_previously_published': 'nan'}"

This BPA combines all strategic operational risk analysis initiatives currently conducted for the DCO under a single framework supporting strategic planning and program management.
 
 The BPA will primarily support two (2) initiatives in place to assess and model maritime risk: the Maritime Security Risk Analysis Model (MSRAM) and the Risk Based Maritime Security Response Operations (RBMSRO) optimization tool. Other operational risk assessments and enterprise risk management efforts are also expected to leverage this BPA.
 
 Supporting the MSRAM includes determining security risk to Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) from terrorist attacks that could have significant national and international impacts. CIKR are assets, systems, and/or resources essential to the economy, public health, safety, and security of the nation. Examples of CIKR covered in this BPA are port infrastructure and systems, waterways, vessels and facilities, petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, nuclear material, cargo and tank vessels as well as other vessels, sites and structures designated as CIKR. Maritime CIKR (MCIKR) patrol is operationalized through the key port areas (KPA) patrol concept and the Risk Based Maritime Security Response Operations (RBMSRO) tool. Supporting the RBMSRO optimization tool includes effectively analyzing USCG PWCS missions accomplished by law enforcement assets; providing USCG with a means to plan, execute, and report Maritime Security Response Operations activities. In addition, this BPA will support the enhancement of risk communication using existing information technology in the USCG and Federal Government enterprise.
 
 Determining risk shall be accomplished by assessing risk factors such as threat, consequence, frequency and vulnerability using computer models. The risk models will address these factors taking into account awareness, prevention, protection, response, recovery and resiliency. The analysis of the security risk results can be integrated into other strategic, operational, and tactical programs to allow for risk-informed decisions in resource and personnel allocation to reduce risk both nationally and abroad. The information from the risk models feeds decision makers within the USCG and external customers at the local, state, and federal levels to inform resource allocation, policy, and budget decisions.

 Waste sampling and characterization of materials from containment and non-containment spaces to ensure disposal paths meet regulatory requirements. Materials to be characterized for hazardous and radiological materials. Develop and execute the sampling plan and provide the samples to suitable vendor(s). Bio-containment materials to be processed out of containment in accordance specifications defined by the PIADC Biosafety and Select Agent Program Office (BSAPO) 
 
 Planning for and execution of a significant amount of waste removal. Pipes, pumps, motors, conduit, wires, ductwork, lab equipment, and demolition debris are examples. Asbestos remediation and some lead abatement where warranted.  Develop and execute plans to safely disassemble and remove such material. Design and installation of temporary systems such as lighting and ventilation may also be required. 
 
 Biological decontamination of materials and spaces is foundational work for the program. Some materials will be decontaminated and removed through well-established technologies such as operating autoclaves, material remaining in bio-containment spaces, and the spaces themselves, will need to be decontaminated utilizing other technologies such as fumigation. Decontamination may be aided through pre-cleaning steps utilizing best available technologies.  Removal of equipment and in laboratory spaces (e.g. virkon-s washdown) prior to their removal for terminal decontamination. Sub-contracts with vendors for specialized services (e.g. fumigation) will likely be required. 
 
 Engineering and construction on a small scale may be required for reconfiguration of spaces and infrastructure systems and components. The PICS program, for example, is anticipating a phased approach to decontamination that may require the design, installation, and testing of biological barriers to separate targeted areas of the building at various project phases. Needs may also be dependent on the specific technology to be utilized.
 
 Confirmation of decontamination effectiveness will be required through extensive sampling and independent analysis. Biological indicators, chemical indicators, and parametric data loggers (will be placed in  defined and tracked locations (specified by others) and then recovered and transferred to others for independent analysis. Quality control and documentation rigor for sample placement and recovery is high. Use a provided Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for sample location records and chain of custody is required.  
 
 Historic records retrieval, assessment, and disposition from historic buildings where access presents multiple ES&H risks (e.g. structural degradation, mold). The contractor may be required to assist in planning and execution of recovery efforts including the design and installation of building stabilization equipment and physically removing records.  
 
 Waste Management Area (WMA) monitoring and closure and other spill sites are subject to the approval of the NYSDEC. Actions may include, excavation of historic land-fill materials, and off-site shipment and disposal of soil and contaminants, capping former waste management areas; the installation of sampling wells for groundwater monitoring, decommissioning of monitoring wells, and collection of environmental samples.

Validation of a thermal infrared model is the comparison between model output against field experiment data including spectral surface properties and temperature measurements. Models for persons in the water (PIW) are required for this research as they are one of the smallest and most challenging objects to find in the water. A critical question in this research is how the inclusion of persons on board (POB) a boat or life raft changes the probability of detection of a life raft. For example, if there are 6 persons on board a raft, the body heat of the persons and change in draft may significantly change the thermal signature of that object, impacting its detectability with an infrared sensor.

CBP is responsible for the detection and apprehension of individuals who are inadmissible or who attempt to unlawfully enter the U.S.; stemming the flow of drugs and other contraband; protecting our agricultural and economic interests from harmful pests and diseases; protecting American business from theft of their intellectual property; and regulating and facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, CBP total apprehensions were 2,899,580.  Most of all apprehensions occurs within the CBP Southwest Border (SWB) Sectors and Field Offices which averaged 5,852 detainees per day that required transportation and guard services. Approximately 1,045,247 out of 2,136,038 apprehensions (49%) occurred within the Texas/New Mexico Corridor (TNMC).
 
 Supporting this responsibility, CBP has identified requirements for performance-based transportation and facilities guard services to include medical escort services capabilities that minimize the use of frontline agents and officers to perform guard and detainee transportation duties. These capabilities must deploy the most efficient mix of detention transport vehicles and human resources capable of adjusting to changes in transportation demand that may vary by shift, day, week, or season.  The solution includes the use of Contractor support to provide the detainee transportation services and ffacility guard services to redirect agents and officers toward more traditional law enforcement duties.  Contract support must strike a proper balance in terms of timeliness and efficiency when responding to the unique demands of frontline agents and officers. 
 
 This program supports operational mission requirements established by the Office of Border Patrol (OBP) and Office of Field Operations (OFO), both within CBP.
