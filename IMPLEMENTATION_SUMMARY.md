# Data Sources Delete Button Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Advanced.tsx (`/Users/zach/Documents/Git/JPS-Prospect-Aggregate/frontend-react/src/pages/Advanced.tsx`)

**Added Imports:**
- `useDeleteDataSource` from `@/hooks/api/useDataSources`
- `Button` from `@/components/ui`
- `DataSource` from `@/types` (to use shared interface)

**Added Functionality:**
- **Delete mutation initialization**: Added `const deleteMutation = useDeleteDataSource()`
- **Delete handler function**: Created `handleDelete()` with confirmation dialog and error handling
- **Updated Actions column**: Modified the table to include both "Run Scraper" and "Delete" buttons in a flex container

**Key Features:**
- Confirmation dialog before deletion with warning about cascade deletion
- Loading state shows "Deleting..." during deletion
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Automatic refresh of data sources list after successful deletion
- Consistent styling with existing UI components

### 2. Updated DataSource Interface (`/Users/zach/Documents/Git/JPS-Prospect-Aggregate/frontend-react/src/types/index.ts`)

**Enhanced Interface:**
- Updated to match the complete structure used in Advanced.tsx
- Added all required fields: `url`, `description`, `last_scraped`, `prospectCount`, `last_checked`
- Made `type` optional for backward compatibility
- Changed `id` type from `string | number` to `number` for consistency

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses existing `useDeleteDataSource` hook that calls `DELETE /api/data-sources/{id}`
- Backend endpoint already implemented with proper cascade deletion
- Frontend hook handles query invalidation and cache updates

### UI/UX Improvements
- Delete button styled with destructive variant (red)
- Buttons grouped in a flex container with proper spacing
- Disabled state during ongoing operations
- Clear visual feedback during deletion process

### Error Handling
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Try-catch block with user-friendly error messages
- Automatic query invalidation ensures UI stays in sync

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend-react/src/pages/Advanced.tsx`**
   - Added delete functionality to data sources advanced tab
   - Imports, mutation setup, handler function, and UI updates

2. **`frontend-react/src/types/index.ts`**
   - Enhanced DataSource interface to match backend response
   - Ensured consistency across components

## Testing

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully without TypeScript errors
- ✅ Backend API endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ Delete functionality integrated with existing working infrastructure
- ✅ Consistent with standalone DataSources.tsx implementation

## Result

The Advanced tab's data sources section now has full delete functionality that matches the standalone DataSources page, maintaining consistency in the user experience while leveraging all existing backend infrastructure.
