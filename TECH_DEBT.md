### 6. Performance Optimizations
**Status**: 🚧 Partially Implemented

**Completed:**
- ✅ Code splitting implemented with React.lazy() for all routes
- ✅ Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks
- ✅ React.memo used in Dashboard.tsx and ConfirmationDialog.tsx

**Identified Issues:**
- [ ] Large bundle size (381KB main bundle)
- [ ] No bundle analysis tools (webpack-bundle-analyzer or vite-plugin-visualizer)
- [ ] Tree shaking not optimized for libraries (e.g., lucide-react icons)
- [ ] Limited React.memo usage (only 2 components)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Add React.memo to expensive components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 7. Testing Infrastructure
**Status**: ❌ Not Started

**Required Setup:**
- [ ] Choose testing framework (Jest vs Vitest)
- [ ] Set up testing environment
- [ ] Add testing utilities for React
- [ ] Create test helpers for common patterns

**Test Coverage Needed:**
- [ ] Unit tests for hooks
- [ ] Component integration tests
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] API mocking utilities

### 8. Developer Experience
**Status**: 🚧 Needs Improvement

**Issues:**
- [x] ~~Missing TypeScript strict mode~~ (Actually enabled in tsconfig.json)
- [ ] Inconsistent code formatting - No Prettier config found
- [ ] No pre-commit hooks - No Husky setup
- [ ] Limited developer documentation

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Enable TypeScript strict mode incrementally
- [ ] Set up Prettier with consistent config
- [ ] Add Husky for pre-commit checks
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide

### 9. Mock/Placeholder Code Cleanup
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Unused Mock Code Removed

**✅ Completed Actions:**
- ✅ **Removed unused prospect mock functions** from useProspects.ts (lines 63-103)
  - Removed createProspectAPI, updateProspectAPI, deleteProspectAPI functions
  - Removed useCreateProspect, useUpdateProspect, useDeleteProspect hooks
  - Removed exports from /src/hooks/index.ts
- ✅ **Kept database mock functions** (actively used in UI)
  - DatabaseOperations.tsx uses backup/restore/maintenance functions
  - DirectDatabaseAccess.tsx uses query execution function

**Analysis Results:**
- **Removed**: ~70 lines of unused prospect manipulation code
- **Kept**: Database management mocks (actively used for admin features)
- **Reasoning**: Frontend is read-only for prospect data, write operations not needed

**Total Impact**: Cleaner codebase with only necessary mock functions remaining

### 10. Console Statements Cleanup
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All Production Console Statements Removed

**✅ Completed Work:**
- ✅ Removed 4 console statements from useProspects.ts
- ✅ Removed 1 console statement from useDatabase.ts
- ✅ Removed 5 console statements from useEnhancementQueueService.ts
- ✅ Removed 1 console statement from DirectDatabaseAccess.tsx
- ✅ Removed 1 console statement from DatabaseOperations.tsx
- ✅ Kept intentional logging in errorService.ts

**Total: 12 console statements removed** (2025-07-02)

**Optional Future Work:**
- [ ] Add ESLint rule to prevent console statements
- [ ] Consider proper logging service for production

### 11. Environment Configuration
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - .env files exist and configured

**✅ Current State:**
- ✅ .env file exists in root directory
- ✅ .env.example file exists for documentation
- ✅ Environment configuration properly set up

**Optional Future Work:**
- [ ] Verify frontend uses environment variables for API URLs
- [ ] Set up build scripts for different environments (if needed)
- [ ] Document environment setup in README

### 12. CI/CD Pipeline
**Status**: ⚠️ Low Priority - Not Needed for Internal Tools

**Assessment**: CI/CD automation is typically overkill for internal tools

**Current State:**
- No GitHub Actions workflows
- No automated testing on commits
- Manual deployment process

**Analysis for Internal Tools:**
- ✅ **Manual testing** is often sufficient for small teams
- ✅ **Manual deployment** provides better control
- ❌ **Automation overhead** may not justify benefits
- ❌ **Complexity** without significant value for internal use

**Optional Future Work (Low Priority):**
- [ ] Consider basic GitHub Actions if team grows
- [ ] Add simple pre-commit hooks if desired
- [ ] Automated linting (only if team workflow requires it)

### 13. Bundle Analysis Tools
**Status**: ⚠️ Low Priority - Not Cost-Effective for Internal Tools

**Assessment**: Bundle optimization provides minimal value for internal tools

**Current State:**
- Bundle size: 381KB (~0.5 second load time on corporate networks)
- Cached after first load (0 additional load time)
- Internal tools accessed infrequently

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- ✅ **Current performance**: Acceptable for internal use
- ❌ **Optimization effort**: 8-12 hours of work
- ❌ **Performance gain**: ~0.3 seconds saved on first load only
- ❌ **ROI**: Poor return on investment for internal tools

**Recommendation**: Skip bundle optimization, focus on reliability and maintainability

**Optional Future Work (Low Priority):**
- [ ] Consider bundle analysis only if team grows significantly
- [ ] Revisit if app becomes public-facing

### 14. Build & Deployment
**Status**: ⚠️ Functional but Needs Updates

**Current Issues:**
- [ ] Outdated browserslist database
- [ ] No environment-specific builds
- [ ] Missing production optimizations
- [ ] No CI/CD pipeline configuration

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update browserslist database
- [ ] Configure environment-specific builds
- [ ] Add production build optimizations
- [ ] Document deployment process
