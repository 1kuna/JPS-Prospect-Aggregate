- **Simplify and Reduce Redundancy**
  - Proactively identify and suggest refactoring for redundant or repetitive code, prioritizing readability and maintainability.

- **Codebase Structure and Naming**
  - Regularly review and suggest improvements to file/folder names and the overall codebase structure, particularly after significant changes or additions.
  - Clearly justify any suggested structural or naming changes; always await explicit user approval before making these changes.

- **Cleaner, Modern Patterns**
  - Suggest cleaner, modern coding patterns, structures, and styles that enhance clarity and maintainability, even if these differ from existing conventions. Always clearly explain the benefits of proposed changes.

- **Reduce Total Code Volume (Thoughtfully)**
  - Actively look for opportunities to reduce total lines of code or files without negatively affecting readability, robustness, or functionality. Only apply these reductions after user confirmation.

- **Maintain Functional Integrity**
  - Never alter existing functionality without explicit instruction. Clearly document the intention behind any change.
