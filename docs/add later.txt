LLM enrichment of data
    - add missing naics codes
    - infer more naics codes for better search/filtering
        - try to stay within the 4-digit parent for inferring when one is already present UNLESS it's generic
    - mark all inferred data with blue text (like tesla autopilot blue)
    - let users filter between original and inferred included
    - status on the advanced page and start/stop button for LLM enrichment

marking opportunities as go/no-go
    - potentially showing who logged such and when they did for queued manual verification
